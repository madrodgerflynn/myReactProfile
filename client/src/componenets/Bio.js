        <p>Welcome! My name is Tyler Anderson and this is a little about me.</p>
        <p>
          I have always had an interest in all things computer related but got
          distracted by another subject when I was in college, and graduated
          with a BS in Anthropology instead. I have always held a secret desire
          to code and finally took the plunge, and completed the DU Coding
          Bootcamp.
